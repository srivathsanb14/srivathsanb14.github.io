    <h1>Opening the Black Box – Model Interpretability in Protein AI</h1>
    
    <p>As artificial intelligence becomes more embedded in scientific and medical applications, interpretability is crucial. Scientists and medical professionals need to understand how AI models reach their conclusions to ensure that these insights are reliable and actionable.</p>
    
    <h2>Importance of Interpretability in Scientific AI</h2>
    <p>In sensitive fields like drug discovery, understanding why an AI model predicts a certain interaction is critical for validation. Without interpretability, researchers risk deploying models with unknown biases or overlooked flaws.</p>
    
    <h2>Techniques for Making Protein AI Models Transparent</h2>
    <p>Several methods are making AI in protein science more interpretable:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Attention Mechanisms:</strong> These mechanisms in transformer models highlight which amino acids contribute most to predictions, revealing potential functional sites within proteins.</li>
        <li><strong>SHAP Values and Feature Attribution:</strong> SHAP values quantify each feature's contribution to a prediction, helping researchers understand which molecular features (like specific residues or structural motifs) drive results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite these tools, interpreting complex models like transformers and GNNs remains challenging, particularly in high-stakes applications. Nevertheless, ongoing work in interpretability is bridging this gap, ensuring that AI’s potential in protein science is realized safely and responsibly.</p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>As interpretability techniques continue to evolve, AI is becoming an indispensable tool in protein science, driving more transparent and reliable models. By focusing on both accuracy and interpretability, we can ensure that AI insights in protein science are both valuable and trustworthy, setting a foundation for even more advanced applications in the future.</p>
